Description:
    The spec generator creates a set of controller
    specs that are ready to use as the starting point for your
    application. 
    
    The generator takes the name of the controller as its first argument. So 
    "simple_spec_controller ConceptController" will generate a 
    concept_controller_spec controller spec.
    
Examples:
    ./script/generate simple_spec_controller ConceptController
